# **Image Processing with GDAL**

This repository is created and maintained to introduce GEOM 2000/7000 (2019) students to image processing by using 
[GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/). Three main subjects will be covered:

- Introduction to on-line image processing (links to examples)
- Image pre-processing and algebra (e.g. QA/QC, subsetting, band ratios )
- Image Classification, Modelling and Simple Time Series

Student will learn how to develop and run image processing code using [Jupiter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
