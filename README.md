# **_Image Processing with GDAL_**

This repository is created to introduce GEOM 2000/7000 students to image processing by using 
GDAL [http://www.gdal.org/]. Three main themes will be covered:

- Introduction to on-line image processing (links to examples)
- Image Corrections and Algebra 
- Image Classification, Modelling and Simple Time Series

#### _Setup Python distribution in Anaconda_

1) Download Anaconda [https://www.anaconda.com/download/]: it comes with 
a nice suit of packages with python distribution. Install the 32-bit version 
for python 3.6 as the 64 bit will conflict with your Arcmap distribution. 
If you are not doing anything with the Arcpy module in ArcGIS then install the 64 bit. 
It's better and include a Jupiter Console
2) Install GDAL in Anaconda: go to >start>All programs>Anaconda Prompt and type >
 
```conda install -c conda-forge gdal``` or ```conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken gdal```

   at the command prompt. You will be prompted to say yes y to complete the installation. 
   This process works better when no proxy is limiting the planet software installation, 
   if this is the case send me an email to rodbio2008@gmail.com
