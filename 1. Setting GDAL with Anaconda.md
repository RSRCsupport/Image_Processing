### The first steps will be:
 1) Install Anaconda (python distribution) and GDAL 
 2) Clone an introductory jupiter notebook [such as this one](https://github.com/RSRCsupport/Image_Processing/blob/master/1_Intro_notebook.ipynb) and run it in your Anaconda environment. 

#### _1) Setup Python distribution in Anaconda and install GDAL_

> a) Download Anaconda [https://www.anaconda.com/download/]: it comes with 
a nice suit of packages with python distribution. Install the 32-bit version 
for python 3.6 as the 64 bit will conflict with your Arcmap distribution. 
If you are not doing anything with the Arcpy module in ArcGIS then install the 64 bit. 
It's better and include a Jupiter Console

> b) Install GDAL in Anaconda: go to >start>All programs>Anaconda Prompt and type >
 
        conda install -c conda-forge gdal  

or alternatively

       conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken gdal
       
>   at the command prompt. You will be prompted to say yes to complete the installation. This process works better when no proxy is limiting the planet software installation, if this is the case send me an email to rodbio2008@gmail.com

#### _2) Clone a Jupiter Notebook to your local drive and open it in Anaconda_
 
> Instructions here how to clone with PyCharm? and how to open the notebook once you get it in your local drive
> Once you have cloned your repository, change directory to where the Jupyter notebooks are located in the repository folder (e.g., the notebooks directory) and start Jupyter with the jupyter notebook command.
or just fire up jupiter notebook from Anaconda and cick upload to load the notebook you cloned and run it from there
probably include here some screenshots for all the steps?
