### The first steps will be:
 1) Install Anaconda (python distribution) and GDAL 
 2) Clone a git repository with the introductory jupiter notebook [(see it here)](https://github.com/RSRCsupport/Image_Processing/blob/master/1_Intro_notebook.ipynb) and run it in your Anaconda environment.

#### 1) Install Anaconda (python distribution) and GDAL 

a) Download [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/): it comes with 
a nice suit of Python programming language packages. Install the 64-Bit version 
for python 3.6. If you are using the arcpy module in ArcGIS then install the 32-Bit version as the 64-Bit will conflict with your Arcgis python distribution 


b) Install GDAL in Anaconda: 

- In windows 7 go to > start> All programs> Anaconda Prompt
- In windows 10 go to > search > and type Anaconda Prompt. On both cases type this in the prompt to install GDAL:
 
 
        conda install -c conda-forge gdal  

or alternatively

       conda install -c conda-forge/label/broken gdal
       
You will be prompted to say yes to complete the installation. This process works better 
when no proxy is limiting the GDAL software installation, if this is the case send me an email to rodbio2008@gmail.com to find a solution
The purpose of installing GDAL within Anaconda is to have this library available 
(i.e. to import it) in the Jupyter notebooks that contain the code for these tutorials
#### 2) Clone a Jupiter Notebook to your local drive and open it in Anaconda

a) To clone a git repository (i.e. have a local copy of code, files that change over time in your PC) you need to install first [git.exe](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that will enable you to  
 
> Instructions here how to clone with PyCharm? and how to open the notebook once you get it in your local drive
> Once you have cloned your repository, change directory to where the Jupyter notebooks are located in the repository folder (e.g., the notebooks directory) and start Jupyter with the jupyter notebook command.
or just fire up jupiter notebook from Anaconda and cick upload to load the notebook you cloned and run it from there
probably include here some screenshots for all the steps?
